<p class="log-img-caption">Soon Cloggy will be a place where everyone can post their SHIT <span class="nowrap">(<i>Special High Intensity Transmissions</i>).</span></p>

<p class="log-h1">We need a platform that will be used to make the world an amazing place for everyone.</p>
And that's what this platform will be used for.

On Cloggy we'll be focused on making the world amazing for everyone, including your mom.

All people amazing.
All land amazing.
All live amazing.


<p class="log-h1">I'm thinking that all SHIT can be placed in toilets instead of using hashtags, subreddits, et cetera.</p>
Maybe some toilets are coveted to be featured in.

Maybe some toilets lead straight to the sanitation department.

Maybe some toilets lead to farmland where the thing you post is used to fertilize a farm of thought or something.

Not sure how things will be set up exactly and how SHIT will be sorted, but one thing I do know is that this platform will be focused on making sure that we are building an amazing society for all people on all land.


<img src="http://whomanatee.org/media/files/cloggy/poop-toilet-emoji.png" class="img-fluid w-100 dim-85" alt="Emoji of a toilet and poop next to each, enlarged to a very large size" />
<p class="log-img-caption mx-auto" style="max-width: 620px;">These toilet and poop emoji are very detailed and impressive, a visual delight for those of us with a taste for the finest emoji.</p>


<p class="log-h1">Have you built web software before? Cloggy will be built in the public eye and you can learn along as it's built.</p>
I've built a bunch of software in the past and did it for about 15 years as a profession both in the public and private sectors, including work for the US government.

So if you want to learn how to build software that runs on the internet or how to build software in general, this will be an opportunity to do so.

Everyone can learn how to build software, regardless of past experience and regardless of what you think you're capable of.

It's technical at times. It's creative at times. It's similar to working construction at times. And you get a chance to learn some graphic design, too.

With the right people and the right environment, building software can be a very fun and rewarding experience.


<p class="log-h1">We'll also build mobile applications, including how to build an API.</p>
Do you know what an <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API</a> is needed for?

What would a world be without APIs?

In short, APIs provide a way for software to exchange data with other software.


<p class="log-h1">Which technologies will be used?</p>
For servers, I'm planning on running things on <a href="https://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. We could eventually run on something like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Digital Ocean, and eventually we'll have our own server farm to run the platform.

But for now, we'll use Heroku since there is much less work needed as compared to running on platforms like AWS and Digital Ocean.

Interestingly, Heroku runs on AWS. Do you know what else runs on AWS? All of Amazon and also a large chunk of the internet. Netflix, a competitor for Amazon Prime Video, also runs on AWS. Fascinating stuff.

We'll use <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> for the web application framework and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for a framework to help with HTML and CSS. And of course we'll write some <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript</a>, and maybe even use <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">Jquery</a> if we're feeling adventurous. For data storage I'm leaning towards using  <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgresql</a>, but I will be looking around to see if it makes sense to use something else.

So all solid tools, all open source, all popular tools, all tools with excellent documentation, and all tools with vibrant communities.

Interestingly, Bootstrap is something that came about from Xwitter back in the day and became an open source project that anyone can contribute to.

So if you're not too familiar with those technologies, now is a chance to get acquainted. Try and figure out why humans made all these tools in the first place. What was life like before we had them? Including why did we make HTML and CSS? What are they used for?

In terms of making an API, we'll use <a href="http://tastypieapi.org/ " target="_blank">Tastypie</a>, which is a framework for Django, which I previously mentioned is also a framework itself.

Frameworks for frameworks for frameworks et cetera.

Everyone builds on everyone in the software community and it's a beautiful thing.


<p class="log-h1">What about Artificial Intelligence? Will Cloggy use AI?</p>
Well, first off, what exactly is natural intelligence? Hmmm... seems to be that what we call "intelligence" is just fancy pattern matching that our brains can do.

And it's this same fancy pattern matching that anything with a neural network uses to make decisions, including beings like cats, dogs, squirrels, and your mom.

So yes, we will use fancy pattern matching to help get this place all sorted out.

For example, I'm thinking that instead of deleting posts, they get automatically sent down certain toilets. Unlike other sites, we won't be running ads, so we can keep everything without worry of advertisers pulling off the platform.

If you're interested in this thing called AI, stay tuned and we will all learn more about it together.

I've never done any AI work professionally or academically, but from what I understand, it all boils down to a bunch of probability graphs and the program, AKA the AI, is trying to weigh the odds to make a decision.

Side note, quick shout out to a human named Eli for explaining AI to me. Eli and I got into a conversation randomly in 2017 at a fast casual Italian spot in Little Italy in SF, where we struck up a conversation while eating our pasta.

You ever hear of a guy named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhlNSLQAFE" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>? He wasn't in favor of calling it Artificial Intelligence and instead wanted to call it Advanced Computing.

Maybe we should just call it what it is: <i>Pattern Matching Software</i>.

Or <i>Probability Matching Software</i> also works.

Or even shorter: <i>Pattern Program</i> or <i>Probability Program</i>.

Our brains too are weighing the odds and then bubbling up a decision for us to make based on our current knowledge.


<p class="log-h1">Who's up for building software to create an amazing world for all?</p>
If so, attend a public <a href="http://whomanatee.org/discussion" target="_blank">discussion</a> near you to learn more. The discussions will start in the US of America and then continue worldwide.

I hope to see everyone soon.

And I hope we all get to see an amazing world emerge before us in the near future.

your fellow human in humanity,
M~
