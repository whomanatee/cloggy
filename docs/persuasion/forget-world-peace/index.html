<p class="log-img-caption">Why aim for anything other than amazing for everyone?</span></p>

<p class="log-h1">Who wants World Peace? Not me, I want World Amazing.</p>
I hear people all around the world advocate for World Peace.

Is World Peace the best that humanity can do?

Peace needs justice.

Justice needs punishment.

And punishment will never fix a human.

Punishment may prevent humans from hurting others again, but it won't create a world where people never commit acts against others in the first place.


<p class="log-h1">Hypothetically, what happens after World Peace is achieved?</p>
Do we just keep living the way we're living?

Working ourselves to death?

Having to always worry about money, with only a select few never needing to worry about working or money?

Is this how we want to keep living as a species?

Or do we want to live in an amazing world where no one has to work too much, no one has to worry about money, no one has to worry about eating, no more kids getting killed, <a href="http://whomanatee.org/goals-and-benefits" target="_blank">et cetera</a>.

It is true that World Peace would be an improvement for many worldwide.

But World Amazing would be more than an improvement.

World Amazing would make the world amazing for everyone.


<p class="log-h1">So why continue fighting for World Peace? Join me and let's fight together for World Amazing.</p>
Join me in fighting for a world where everyone lives amazing.

Everyone worldwide is invited to come out to a free and public <a href="http://whomanatee.org/discussion" target="_blank" class="nowrap">discussion</a> to discuss how we will create an amazing world for all.

I plan to show everyone that creating an amazing world is the only solution to all of humanity's issues. Striving for peace will never work to fix all of humanity's issues. In order to fix anything permanently, we must strive for amazing, and we must make everything amazing in one go, worldwide.

Whether you are already convinced or not, I hope to see everyone soon at a public discussion.

And I hope we all soon get to see an amazing world and an amazing humanity emerge before our eyes.

your fellow human in humanity,
M~
